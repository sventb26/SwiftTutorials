//Swift extensions are the smart way to add functionality to existing types, and you're going to meet them time and time again â€“ and hopefully write quite a few of
//your own too. They aren't all-encompassing, because they don't let you add properties to a class whereas a full subclass would, but they are easy to use and easy
//to share so I'm sure you'll use them frequently.
